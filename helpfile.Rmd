========================================================
This web application is based on application of machine learning on famous **Fisher's Iris data set**.This data set has 5 features i.e 4 predictor variables(Petal.Length,Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width) and one response variable(Species).

This application has 5 tabs(sections) and 
they are:    

1. **Predict Species** : This tab is used to predict species based on user's input. The user has to choose values using sliders for given fields:   
      . Sepal Length    
      . Sepal Width  
      . Petal Length   
      . Petal Width  
      
  After chosing these values, when user clicks 'Predict!' button, the predicted species for user's input will be displayed on right side of the same tab.

2. **Iris Data**   : This tab helps user to browse Iris dataset.User can click on any column's header to sort the column. User can  navigate through pages.User can choose number of records per page to be displayed on the top-left. User can search any value in  the data  through search field on top-right. 

3. **Analysis** : This tab displays summary and scatterplot of iris data set.

4. **Prediction Model**   :  This tab displays:   
  . the machine learning model(random forest) used for this application  
  . a property table of model prediction for out of sample data showing how much percentage of each species are misclassified in out of sample data.  
  . a plot displaying important variable for the model    

5. **Documentation**  :  This tab helps user to use this application.       

User can navigate to any tab by clicking on the tab.
